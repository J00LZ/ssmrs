# SSMrs
[Simple stack machine](https://github.com/atzedijkstra/ssm) rewritten in Rust. 
(Well okay, only the cpu itself and not the fancy gui)
(and also only the instructions needed for the course "Talen & Compilers" at Utrecht University)

## Manual
You can find the manual [here](https://webspace.science.uu.nl/~hage0101/SSM/instructions.html). 
This implementation is only compatible at the assembly level, since it uses different opcodes. 
Maybe in the future it will be made even bytecode compatible.
